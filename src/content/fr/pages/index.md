Mosaïc : « Œuvre disparate composée de pièces rapportées » [Larousse].  
What better name for a quartet bringing together musicians with roots in Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Romania.  
This diversity brought us together as friends and proves an endless source of musical inspiration.
It is our pleasure to share the results with you, through the language of chamber music.  
The little-known formation of the saxophone quartet won’t fail to surprise you, taking you on a journey across musical borders.
